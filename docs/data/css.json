We assume that the browser has already determined the rules that match a particular element. Among the matching rules, the specificity, four comma-separate values, `a, b, c, d` are calculated for each rule based on the following:\n\n1. `a` is whether inline styles are being used. If the property declaration is an inline style on the element, `a` is 1, else 0.\n2. `b` is the number of ID selectors.\n3. `c` is the number of classes, attributes and pseudo-classes selectors.\n4. `d` is the number of tags and pseudo-elements selectors.\n\nThe resulting specificity is not a score, but a matrix of values that can be compared column by column. When comparing selectors to determine which has the highest specificity, look from left to right, and compare the highest value in each column. So a value in column `b` will override values in columns `c` and `d`, no matter what they might be. As such, specificity of `0,1,0,0` would be greater than one of `0,0,10,10`.\n\nIn the cases of equal specificity: the latest rule is the one that counts. If you have written the same rule into your stylesheet (regardless of internal or external) twice, then the lower rule in your style sheet is closer to the element to be styled, it is deemed to be more specific and therefore will be applied.\n\nI would write CSS rules with low specificity so that they can be easily overridden if necessary. When writing CSS UI component library code, it is important that they have low specificities so that users of the library can override them without using too complicated CSS rules just for the sake of increasing specificity or resorting to `!important`.\n\n###### References\n\n- https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/07/css-specificity-things-you-should-know\n- https://www.sitepoint.com/web-foundations/specificity\n\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)"},"_id":"What-is-CSS-selector-specificity-and-how-does-it-work?","html":{"question":"<p>What is CSS selector specificity and how does it work?</p>","answer":"<p>The browser determines what styles to show on an element depending on the specificity of CSS rules.

It can be fixed by clearing the float after the floated elements in the container but before the close of the container.\n\nThe `.clearfix` hack uses a clever CSS [pseudo selector](#describe-pseudo-elements-and-discuss-what-they-are-used-for) (`:after`) to clear floats. Rather than setting the overflow on the parent, you apply an additional class `clearfix` to it. Then apply this CSS:\n\n```css\n.clearfix:after {\n  content: \" \";\n  visibility: hidden;\n  display: block;\n  height: 0;\n  clear: both;\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, give `overflow: auto` or `overflow: hidden` property to the parent element which will establish a new block formatting context inside the children and it will expand to contain its children.\n\n###### References\n\n- https://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats\n\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)"},{"markdown":{"question":"Describe `z-index` and how stacking context is formed.","answer":"The `z-index` property in CSS controls the vertical stacking order of elements that overlap. `z-index` only affects elements that have a `position` value which is not `static`.\n\nWithout any `z-index` value, elements stack in the order that they appear in the DOM (the lowest one down at the same hierarchy level appears on top).

Instead of a single ball going through several different-sized hoops, you'd have several different balls to use depending on the hoop size.\n\nBoth have these methods have some issues that need to be weighed:\n\n- Responsive design can be quite challenging, as you're essentially using a single albeit responsive layout to fit all situations. How to set the media query breakpoints is one such challenge. Do you use standardized breakpoint values? Or, do you use breakpoints that make sense to your particular layout? What if that layout changes?\n- Adaptive design generally requires user agent sniffing, or DPI detection, etc., all of which can prove unreliable.\n\n###### References\n\n- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Archive/Apps/Design/UI_layout_basics/Responsive_design_versus_adaptive_design\n- http://mediumwell.com/responsive-adaptive-mobile\n- https://css-tricks.com/the-difference-between-responsive-and-adaptive-design\n\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)"},{"markdown":{"question":"Have you ever worked with retina graphics? If so, when and what techniques did you use?","answer":"_Retina_ is just a marketing term to refer to high resolution screens with a pixel ratio bigger than 1. The key thing to know is that using a pixel ratio means these displays are emulating a lower resolution screen in order to show elements with the same size. Nowadays we consider all mobile devices _retina_ defacto displays.\n\nBrowsers by default render DOM elements according to the device resolution, except for images.\n\nIn order to have crisp, good-looking graphics that make the best of retina displays we need to use high resolution images whenever possible. However using always the highest resolution images will have an impact on performance as more bytes will need to be sent over the wire.\n\nTo overcome this problem, we can use responsive images, as specified in HTML5. It requires making available different resolution files of the same image to the browser and let it decide which image is best, using the html attribute `srcset` and optionally `sizes`, for instance:\n\n```html\n<div responsive-background-image>\n  <img\n    src=\"/images/test-1600.jpg\"\n    sizes=\"\n      (min-width: 768px) 50vw,\n      (min-width: 1024px) 66vw,\n      100vw\"\n    srcset=\"\n      /images/test-400.jpg   400w,\n      /images/test-800.jpg   800w,\n      /images/test-1200.jpg 1200w\n    \"\n  />\n</div>\n```\n\nIt is important to note that browsers which don't support HTML5's `srcset` (i.e. IE11) will ignore it and use `src` instead. If we really need to support IE11 and we want to provide this feature for performance reasons, we can use a JavaScript polyfill, e.g. Picturefill (link in the references).\n\nFor icons, I would also opt to use SVGs and icon fonts where possible, as they render very crisply regardless of resolution.\n\n###### References\n\n- https://css-tricks.com/responsive-images-youre-just-changing-resolutions-use-srcset\n- http://scottjehl.github.io/picturefill\n- https://aclaes.com/responsive-background-images-with-srcset-and-sizes\n\n[[↑] Back to top](#table-of-contents)"},"_id":"Have-you-ever-worked-with-retina-graphics?-If-so,-when-and-what-techniques-did-you-use?","html":{"question":"<p>Have you ever worked with retina graphics?
